# Welcome to the online companion to Data Power (Thatcher and Dalton 2021)

I'm going to be honest with you. 2021 has been *a year*. This **will** be an ongoing and perpetually (if infrequently) updated site that shares both our work in the area as well as links outwards to the many, many others doing profoundly exciting work around living with data and technology.

Unfortunately, there's not much done right now and I'm really trying to 躺平 at the end of the year.

So, apologies for now, much more to come, we hope you enjoyed the book and please be in touch if there's something you'd like us to share or just to discuss.
