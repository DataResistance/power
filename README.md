# Welcome to the online companion to Data Power (Thatcher and Dalton 2021)

I'm going to be honest with you. 2021 has been *a year*. This **will** be an ongoing and perpetually (if infrequently) updated site that shares both our work in the area as well as links outwards to the many, many others doing profoundly exciting work around living with data and technology.

Unfortunately, there's not much done right now and I'm really trying to 躺平 at the end of the year.

But, here are a few links to some work we reference in the book:
1. [A guide on scraping running routes in your city](https://github.com/jethatch/DataDerives/tree/master/running-maps_update)
2. [A talk Jim gave on Resistance GIS](https://jethatch.github.io/resistancegis/#/)
3. [Various syllabuses for Critical Data Studies courses over the years](https://github.com/jethatch/syllabuses)
4. [Enfolding - a prototype of a Geographical Imagination System](https://github.com/FoldingSpace/enfolding) made by the wonderful Nick Lally and Luke Bergmann

So, apologies for now, much more to come, we hope you enjoyed the book and please be in touch if there's something you'd like us to share or just to discuss.

-- Jim
